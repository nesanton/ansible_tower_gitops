# Everything as code and GitOps for AWX/RedHat Ansible Automation Platform

This project is about two things:

1. An example of repository structure (see [example_repositories](example_repositories)) to hold the entire configuration of AWX/AAP

2. Assets to help implement a full GitOps style delivery of this configuration using GitLab
